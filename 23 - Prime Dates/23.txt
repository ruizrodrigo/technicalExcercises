Given two dates each in the format dd-mm-yyyy, you have to find the number of lucky dates between them (inclusive). To see if a date is lucky,

Firstly, sequentially concatinate the date, month and year, into a new integer x erasing the leading zeroes.
Now if x is divisible by either 4 or 7, then we call the date a lucky date.

For example, let's take the date "02-08-2024". After concatinating the day, month and year, we get x = 2082024. As x is divisible by 4 so the date "02-08-2024" is called a lucky date.

Input Format

The only line of the input contains two strings u and v denoting the two dates following the format dd-mm-yyyy. Consider, d is the day number, m is the month number and y is the year number.

Note: Here m = 01 means January, m = 02 means February, m = 03 means March and so on and all the dates follow the standard structure of English calender including the leap year.

Constraints

1 <= d1, d2 <= 31
1 <= m1, m2 <= 12
1000 <= y1 <= y2 <= 9999


Output Format

For each test cases, print a single integer the number of lucky dates between  and  in a single line.
