You will be given a list of integers, arr, and a single integer k. You must create an array of length k from elements of arr such that its unfairness is minimized. Call that array arr1. Unfairness of an array is calculated as

    Max(arr1) - Min(arr1)

Where:
- max denotes the largest integer in arr1
- min denotes the smallest integer in arr1

Example

arr = [1,4,7,2]
k = 2

Pick any two elements, say arr1 = [4,7].
unfairness = max(4,7) - min(4,7) = 7 - 4 = 3

Testing for all pairs, the solution [1,2] provides the minimum unfairness.

Note: Integers in arr may not be unique.

Function Description

Complete the maxMin function in the editor below.
maxMin has the following parameter(s):
    int k: the number of elements to select
    int arr[n]:: an array of integers

Returns

int: the minimum possible unfairness

Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in array arr.
The second line contains an integer k.
Each of the next n lines contains an integer arr[i] where 0<= i < n .

Constraints

2 <= n <= 10^5
2 <= k <= next
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9


Sample Input

10
4
1
2
3
4
10
20
30
40
100
200

Sample Output

3

Explanation

Here k = 4; selecting the 4 integers 1,2,3,4, unfairness equals

max(1,2,3,4) - min(1,2,3,4) = 4 - 1 = 3
